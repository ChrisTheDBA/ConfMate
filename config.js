	    	'<p>We have been doing JSConf for 5 years with 10 events across the world and every single one has been better than the previous, it is something we take a great deal of pride in. We make events that aren\'t from the standard conference playbook, because we believe you deserve more than that. We have always retained some core concepts, the most fundamental of which is to always focus on the human social development aspect of the event. The second is to always indulge every attendee well beyond that which they have paid. The third is to always treat attendees, staff, sponsors, and speakers with the utmost of respect and appreciation. We have been a launching point for an incredible number of the most revolutionary products, services, and technologies on the web.',
	    	'<p>The JSConf team is constantly working to make the best technology event possible, which means not just creating events, but embracing a mission. Whether it is actively working to fix the diversity in computing issue, help feed the hungry, or try to fix the rampant negativity in our community, we are deeply dedicated making our (and your) world a better place. We want you to be part of it, we want you to be part of the JSConf family and help us with our mission.</p>',
