If not handled correctly, such a volume of information can overwhelm both the infrastructure that needs to support them, and people who have to make a sense out of thousands of signals and make decisions upon them, fast. By understanding how our rational mind works, how people process information, we can present data so it's more evident and intuitive. This talk will explain how to collect useful metrics, and to create the perfect monitoring dashboard to organise and display them, letting our intuition operate automatically and quickly, and saving attention and mental effort to activities that demand it.",

This talk will leverage the extensibility and configurability of Symfony2 to easily create a reusable and testable REST API in minutes. Watch as we cover some real world examples and fill the gap where the abstraction layer falls short in providing the implementation for specific requirements. We will dive into how data can be serialized & deserialized with little effort as possible whilst supporting different formats, namely JSON & XML. Authentication and Authorization will be visited in order to exemplify the security aspects of a real world API. Sam will talk about how to document the API without effort and have that documentation generated automatically for end user consumption.

The first part of the presentation concludes with a section on ‘tricks’ and the best practices used to optimise web applications. The second part of the presentation focuses on data analysis, how to track and measure applications and why the use of software metrics that push information are essential. Delegates will be shown practical examples of how Terravision uses Statsd, Sentry versus Graylog for the error behavior analysis of users, applications, operating systems and web servers.

      "description":"Launching a product on the web some years ago was a massive, long awaited moment you could spend years working to towards. Nowadays you heard the term MVP (minimum viable product) a lot more than 'Version 1.0'. Agile is winning over the web and 'shipping it once' is not something people get all that excited about any more. The question is not 'When to we ship' but 'how often do we ship' and 'what do we ship'. Our ability as developers to continuously roll out changes at a sustained pace changed the game we are playing in web development. This talk aims to give an overview over the progression of developers into the current age of 'getting stuff out of the door so that we ether make money or realize it's not a good idea (yet)'. What tools, processes, roles... people do we need in our teams. What mindset helps or hinders us? Getting the code written once is easy, getting it changed is a little hard but constantly going through the whole cycle of truing ideas into usable product features is the real challenge nowadays. It's hard because it involve people, business, developers, operators, designers and customers. The nice thing about it is that involves people and if you get a well oiled machine running you can get stuff done really fast. We are going to look at this machine from a developers point of view and discuss where we come in, which part we play and where we should act as supporting cast. We are going to discuss processes and tools for continuous deployment involving business and operations to see how we can help creating amazing products by working together on: 'getting it done'.",

The powerful combination of Behat and Mink makes writing, and executing automated tests easier. In many cases faster, too. This session introduces you to Behat and Mink, and demonstrates how to write tests for different real-life use-cases, so you can put it to practice right away!",

This will touch on: - scaling static traffic (css/js/imgs) - scaling app traffic (php) - scaling databases (replication, clusters, sharding, ...) - scaling storage (s3, etc) and other topics like job queues, 'wenching' (grouping similar requests for data from unrelated pieces of code via promises), etc The talk is meant for anyone hitting the limits of their single server (VPS or similar) and facing the challenge of scaling up from that.",

In this session we will deploy all the strategies known to man for reaching a fast test suite, from profiling to caching to Fake collaborators, multiple stages and projects, and an hint of parallelism. The technical side is all based on PHP code: usually no external tools other than PHPUnit and Xdebug/Kcachegrind are necessary to halve your running times.",

DBAs on human resources and all of them blame on final users. OK, enough of that: best players are those who don't wait for things to be perfect in order to succeed.
